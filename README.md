# React Utils

A repo with stuff I use in mostly all of my projects, so i can have it only in one place and stop having to copy/paste
it everywhere when i do updates to it.

There won't be any help or guides on how to use this, as they are very specific to my use and environment. This isn't
and probably will never be available on npm.
